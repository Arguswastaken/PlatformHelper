Ever get tired of creating a arena for the Wall of Flesh? This mod fixes that! This mod will help you place platforms faster! While holding the hotkey you specified in the controls menu, and placing a platform of any style, four additional platforms will be placed in front of you! If you are only holding three platforms, than only 3 platforms will be placed!

Place several platforms (or any block really) while holding down a hotkey. Makes making arenas super easy.
